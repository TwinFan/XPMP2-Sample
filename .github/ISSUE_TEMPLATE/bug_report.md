**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Specifically: What did you _want_ to achieve? What was your objective?

**To Reproduce / Source Code Example**
As XPMP2 is a library, not an application, you cannot just describe „steps“. Instead, provide pieces of your code.
Ideally, you provide a sample implementation based on the XPMP2-Sample for me to reproduce your problem.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Version**
 - OS: [Win/Mac/Lin incl. version]
 - X-Plane: [version, rendering mode (Vulkan/Metal/OpenGL)]

**Log.txt**
Attach a `Log.txt` with Debug-level entries of XPMP2 while the problem happens.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
